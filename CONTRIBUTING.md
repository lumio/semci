# How to contribute

Thank you so much for your interest in this project. These are some guidelines on how
to contribute to this project.

## Found a bug?

Awesome! Search through the [issues](https://github.com/lumio/semci/issues) first
and make sure it was not already reported. If you cannot find it, [create a new one](https://github.com/lumio/semci/issues/new).

## Fixed a bug?

Has it been reported yet? If not, create a new issue first.
Open a [pull request for review](https://github.com/lumio/semci/compare). An absolute must: **use [semantic commit messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/)!** Or simply use semci :wink:

## What about whitespace fixes / cosmetic changes?

We use husky in combination with commitlint for automatically beautifying source code.
Everything should be automatic.

Pull requests that only consist of cosmetic changes will be declined. A good reasoning behind this
was summarized on this [Ruby on Rails issue here](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/13771#issuecomment-32746700).

## Do you intend to add a new feature?

Sounds wonderful! Please create a new enhancement issue to further discuss this new feature.
